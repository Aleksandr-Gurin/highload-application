######################## Filebeat Configuration ############################
# You can find the full configuration reference here:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/index.html
# ========================== Filebeat global options ===========================
# Enable filebeat config reloading
filebeat.config:
  modules:
    path: ${path.config}/modules.d/*.yml
    reload.enabled: false
# =========================== Filebeat autodiscover ============================
# Autodiscover allows you to detect changes in the system and spawn new modules
# or inputs as they happen.
filebeat.autodiscover:
  # List of enabled autodiscover providers
  providers:
    - type: docker
      hints.enabled: true
      labels.dedot: true

            equals:
              docker.container.labels.collect_logs_with_filebeat: "true"

# ================================= Processors =================================
# Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to
# enhance the event with external metadata. This section defines a list of
# processors that are applied one by one and the first one receives the initial
# event:
#
#   event -> filter1 -> event1 -> filter2 ->event2 ...
#
# The supported processors are drop_fields, drop_event, include_fields,
# decode_json_fields, and add_cloud_metadata.
processors:
  - decode_json_fields:
      fields: [ "message" ]
      target: "json"
      overwrite_keys: true
  # The following example enriches each event with docker metadata, it matches
  # container id from log path available in `source` field (by default it expects
  # it to be /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log).
  - add_docker_metadata: ~
  # The following example enriches each event with host metadata.
  - add_host_metadata: ~
# ================================== Outputs ===================================
# Configure what output to use when sending the data collected by the beat.
# ---------------------------- Elasticsearch Output ----------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  # Boolean flag to enable or disable the output module.
  enabled: true
  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 9200)
  # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:9200/path
  # IPv6 addresses should always be defined as: https://[2001:db8::1]:9200
  hosts: ['elasticsearch:9200']
  indices:
    - index: "filebeat-%{[agent.version]}-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
# ================================= Dashboards =================================
# These settings control loading the sample dashboards to the Kibana index. Loading
# the dashboards are disabled by default and can be enabled either by setting the
# options here, or by using the `-setup` CLI flag or the `setup` command.
setup.dashboards.enabled: true
# =================================== Kibana ===================================
# Starting with Beats version 6.0.0, the dashboards are loaded via the Kibana API.
# This requires a Kibana endpoint configuration.
setup.kibana:
  # Kibana Host
  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 5601)
  # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:5601/path
  # IPv6 addresses should always be defined as: https://[2001:db8::1]:5601
  host: "kibana:5601"
# ================================== Logging ===================================
# There are four options for the log output: file, stderr, syslog, eventlog
# The file output is the default.
# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: error, warning, info, debug
logging.level: info
# Write Filebeat own logs only to file to avoid catching them with itself in docker log files
# When true, writes all logging output to files. The log files are automatically rotated when the
# log file size limit is reached.
logging.to_files: false
# When true, writes all logging output to the syslog. This option is not supported on Windows.
logging.to_syslog: false
# ============================= X-Pack Monitoring ==============================
# Filebeat can export internal metrics to a central Elasticsearch monitoring
# cluster.  This requires xpack monitoring to be enabled in Elasticsearch.  The
# reporting is disabled by default.
# Set to true to enable the monitoring reporter.
monitoring.enabled: true
# Uncomment to send the metrics to Elasticsearch. Most settings from the
# Elasticsearch output are accepted here as well.
# Note that the settings should point to your Elasticsearch *monitoring* cluster.
# Any setting that is not set is automatically inherited from the Elasticsearch
# output configuration, so if you have the Elasticsearch output configured such
# that it is pointing to your Elasticsearch monitoring cluster, you can simply
# uncomment the following line.
monitoring.elasticsearch:
# Array of hosts to connect to.
# Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 9200)
# In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:9200/path
# IPv6 addresses should always be defined as: https://[2001:db8::1]:9200
#hosts: ["elasticsearch-demo:9200"]
# =============================== HTTP Endpoint ================================
# Each beat can expose internal metrics through a HTTP endpoint. For security
# reasons the endpoint is disabled by default. This feature is currently experimental.
# Stats can be access through http://localhost:5066/stats . For pretty JSON output
# append ?pretty to the URL.
# Defines if the HTTP endpoint is enabled.
http.enabled: true
# The HTTP endpoint will bind to this hostname, IP address, unix socket or named pipe.
# When using IP addresses, it is recommended to only use localhost.
http.host: filebeat
# Port on which the HTTP endpoint will bind. Default is 5066.
http.port: 5066
